# mkdocs-badges
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/mkdocs-badges)](https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-badges/)
![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/mkdocs-badges)
![Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/mkdocs-badges)

This package allows you to add badges to your mkdocs site.

## Setup

Install the plugin using pip:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-badges
```

Then, add the plugin to your `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - search
  - badges
```

> If you have no `plugins` entry in your config file yet, you'll likely also want to add the `search` plugin. MkDocs enables it by default if there is no `plugins` entry set.

More information about plugins in the [MkDocs documentation](http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/plugins/).

## Usage

Badges are defined like this:

```
|@github:six-two/mkdocs-badges|
|"Height":1.58m|
|t:Password|c:Tr0ub4dor&3|v:Tr0ub4dor&3|l:https://xkcd.com/936/|end
```

This should create badges that look like this (actual colors will depend on your theme):

There are different types of badges.

### Normal badges

Normal badges use the syntax `|"Name":value|`.
They just render a badge, but do not react to clicks.
If you want to link to something, you can put the badge in a link like this:

```
[|"Github":mkdocs-badges|](q)
```

### Install badges

Install badges can be used to tell users how to install software.
They are defined like this:

```
|@github:six-two/mkdocs-badges|
```

Clicking on the badge name `Github` will copy the command used to install the software (`git clone https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges`).
Clicking on the badge's value `six-two/mkdocs-badges` will bring the user to the package's site (`https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges`).

The currently supported badge names can be seen in `src/mkdocs_badges/assets/install_badge_data.json`.
You can define also your own badge data and use the `install_badge_data` setting to use it as your data file.

### Custom badges

Custom badges allow users to use the features from install badges (such as copying text on click) for their own custom badges.

They have the following structure:

```
|t:Badge type|c:Text to copy on click|v:Value to show|l:Link to follow when the badge is clicked|end
```

Some of the fields are optional, but they need to be supplied in the correct order:

```
|t:Badge with|v:example link|https://example.com|end
|t:Normal|v:badge|end
```

See the following table for more details:

Field | Type | Description
---|---|---
t: | required | The badge *type* to show on the left side of the badge
c: | optional | Text to *copy*, when (the left side of) the badge is clicked
v: | required | The badge *value* to show on the right side of the badge
l: | optional | *Link* to follow when clicking on (the right side of) the badge
end | required | Signals the end of the badge
