# Badge types

There are multiple different badge types, which different syntaxes.
All badges need to be in their now line and have no indent / leading whitespaces.
Badges inside (fenced) code bocks are also not interpreted.

## Simple badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Simple badges are just a badge that does not react to clicks.

Example markdown:

```
|Example badge|works|
```

Result:

<div class=result>
|Example badge|works|
</div>


## Link badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Link badges link to a given URL.
They only have the (simplified version of) the hostname specified in the link as visible value

Example markdown:

```markdown
L|Bug Tracker|https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges/issues|
L|Simplified hostname demo|https://www.example.com|
```

Result:

<div class=result>
L|Bug Tracker|https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges/issues|
L|Simplified hostname demo|https://www.example.com|
</div>

## Reference link badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Reference link badges link to a given URL using reference links.
They are similar to link badges, but display the reference name as value.

**Warning**: Reference links rely on the underlying markdown parser.
Thus, there badges may not work correctly when inside HTML (like a `<div>` element).
To work araound this, make sure markdown parsing inside HTML is enabled, or only put he badges in `<span>` elements, which do (to my knowledge) not prevent the parsing of Markdown contents.

Example markdown:

```markdown
R|reflink badge|example_ref|
|normal badge with reflink|should work|r:example_ref|

[example_ref]: https://www.example.com
```

Result:

<span class=result>
R|reflink badge|example_ref|
|normal badge with reflink|should work|r:example_ref|
</span>



## Copy badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Copy badges copy their value to the users clipboard when clicked upon

Example markdown:

```markdown
C|Password|monkey123|
C|Linux check ethernet settings|ip a s eth0|
```

Result:

<span class=result>
C|Password|monkey123|
C|Linux check ethernet settings|ip a s eth0|
</span>


## Install badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Install badges are designed to make it easy for users to install software.
Sadly they are a bit unintuitive to use.
Clicking on the badge title (left side) will copy the command to install the software (`git clone ...`, `pip install ...`, `sudo apt install ...`, etc) to the user's clipboard.
To show them that this is possible, the cursor takes the form of a question mark.
To show them what has happened, a popup is shown once they clicked.

The right side is a link to the software on the given platorrm (github repo, PyPI page, linux package tracker, etc).


Example markdown:

Markdown code:
```
I|github|six-two/mkdocs-badges|
I|pypi|mkdocs|
```

Result:

<span class=result>
I|github|six-two/mkdocs-badges|
I|pypi|mkdocs|
</span>


## Tag badges

|Required version|0.3.3+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

!!! note "Requirements"
    This will likely requires you to use Mkdocs Material and [enabling it's `tags` plugin](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-tags/).
    I haven't tested it, but strongly assume that the badges `plugin` will need to be before the `tags` plugin to function properly.

Tag badges add a tag to the page it apears on.
The tags name is derived from the badge's values.
Clicking the badge should open the tags list page at the location where all pages with this tag are listed (assuming ``)

For example the following badge would add the `programming_language_python` tag:
```
T|Programming language|Python|
```

<span class=result>
T|Programming language|Python|
</span>


## Custom badges

|Required version|0.3.0+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

Custom badges offer all features supported by the other badge types (except tag badges).
They have however a more verbose syntax.
On the upside you are in total control about the supplied values, since none of them are automaticaly generated.

Short prefix | Long prefix | Conflicts with | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`.` | `class:` | - | Add a class to the badge, which can be used for custom styling. Can be specified multiple time to add multiple classes. Can also be used with any other badge type
`c:` | `copy:` | reflink | Copy the given text when the badge is clicked
`l:` | `link:` | reflink | Clicking on the badge will direct the user to the given URL
`r:` | `reflink:` | copy, link | Similar to link, but instead it uses the reference link syntax

Example markdown:

```markdown
|Link badge equivalent|example.com|link:https://www.example.com|
|Copy badge equivalent|text to show|copy:text to copy|
|Styled differently|by custom HTML classes|class:version|
|Install badge equivalent|mkdocs-badge|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges|copy:git clone https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges.git|
|Reflink badge equivalent|example.com|r:example_ref|
```

Result:

<span class=result>
|Link badge equivalent|example.com|link:https://www.example.com|
|Copy badge equivalent|text to show|copy:text to copy|
|Styled differently|by custom HTML classes|class:version|
|Install badge equivalent|mkdocs-badge|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges|copy:git clone https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges.git|
|Reflink badge equivalent|example.com|r:example_ref|
</span>


## Single element badge

|Required version|0.3.4+|link:https://github.com/six-two/mkdocs-badges#notable-changes|.version|

This badge only contains a single element (the title) and has no second element (the value).
The same extra attributes that can be set for custom badges can also be used here.
However, you can not use a (ref-)link and a text to copy for the same badge, since only one element exists.

For example the following badge would add the `programming_language_python` tag:
```
S|Single element badge||
S||You can also define the value here|
S|Single element with link||link:https://example.com|
S|Single element with text to copy||copy:single element|
```

<span class=result>
S|Single element badge||
S||You can also define the value here|
S|Single element with link||link:https://example.com|
S|Single element with text to copy||copy:single element|
</span>
