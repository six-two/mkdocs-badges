- rework badge syntax? It currently can not be used in most contexts (lists, etc). Make configurable start (for example ` $[`) and an end (`]$`) that will be searched for when looking for badges anywhere.
- document plugin config options (src/mkdocs_badges/plugin.py)
- document which badge type to use when / how links work (wint normal badged)
- add badge install types: winget, psim (Powershell Install-Module)
